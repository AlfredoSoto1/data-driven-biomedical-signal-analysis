    "# Biomedical Signal Analysis For Stress Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "##### This notebook focuses on analyzing and preprocessing physiological signals from two sources: the **MIMIC-IV Database** and a **Wearable Device Dataset**. Both datasets provide rich biosignal information that can be leveraged to study stress detection. The signals were preprocessed using a bandpass filter to remove noise. A regression model was then developed to estimate stress levels based on the cleaned physiological data.\n",
