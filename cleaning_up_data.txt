Research shows that for stress recognition and predictiablility in ECG, the best leads are Lead II, Lead ! and Lead III. 

Knowing this information helps cleaning up and organizing the specific data needed to detect stress efectively while saving resources. Ranked from top best.

1. Lead II- Best for HRV and stress. It provides the most accurate detection of R-R intervals, crucial for HRV analysis, a key indicator for stress.
->Clinical stress assessment.

2. Lead I- Good for overall heart activity. It provides a detection of general changes in stress-related heart patterns. 
-> Simple stress detection.

3. Lead III. Secondary stress detection. It provides information on the heart activity from a different andgke thab Lead I, offering complementary stress insights.
-> Additional stress analysis.
